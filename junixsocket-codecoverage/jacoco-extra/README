Place additional jacoco *.exec files here to improve code coverage reporting.

Make sure to delete all outdated *.exec files first.

Collect code coverage results by running junixsocket-selftest on all supported
target platforms and configurations. Make sure to test in environments with
certain features enabled/disabled and configured differently (e.g., TIPC
enabled but not configured).

Run the following command to collect these *.exec files on a target system:

./run-selftest-coverage.sh
(this may download the JaCoCo agent jar if it's not already there)

The test files will be stored under junixsocket-codecoverage/target.

Depending on your setup (shared directory or not), you may now need to
aggregate these *.exec files.

Then, on the machine aggregating the results, run

./rerun-aggregate-coverage.sh

which will set up the aggregate report under
junixsocket-codecoverage/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/index.html
