 * Handler interface that is invoked after a cancel on disconnect timeout for an acceptor session.

 *  <li>Your FIX session dictionary must contain a cancel on disconnect type field associated with a establish
 *  message.</li>
 *  <li>A session must specify a CancelOnDisconnectType field in it's establish message that requires
 * a cancel on either logout, disconnect or both</li>
 *  <li>the CODTimeoutWindow also specified in the establish message must have expired without a reconnect</li>
