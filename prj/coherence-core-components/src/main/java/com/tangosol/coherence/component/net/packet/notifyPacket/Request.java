/**
 * A Packet is a unit of data transmission between the Members of the network.
 * There are five different type of Packets: Broadcast, Directed, Sequel,
 * Request and Ack.
 * 
 * A Message Packet represents a whole or a part of a Message. A Message could
 * be sent to a number of recipient Members. There are Broadcast and "point"
 * Message Packets depending on the intended recipients of the Message.
 * 
 * If the Message is being sent to all Members or potential Members, it uses a
 * Broadcast Packet, which is unaddressed (aka no "to" Member id information,
 * and it may not even have a return address, aka a "from" Member id, if the
 * sender has not been assigned a Member id by the cluster). A Message the is
 * formatted into a Broadcast Packet must fit entirely in one Packet.
 * 
 * There are also "point" Message Packets, which come from this Member and go
 * to one or more addressed Members (recipients). For each recipient, there is
 * a sequential counter which is unique in the scope of the sender/recipient
 * pair that a Message is marked with and for each sender there is a global
 * sequential counter that an outgoing Message is marked with. These counters
 * are used to quickly identify incoming point Message Packets, acknowledge
 * them, and determine if any prerequisite point Packets are missing.
 * 
 * There are two types of "point" Message Packets: Directed and Sequel. Each
 * "point" Message is formatted into one Directed Packet and zero or more
 * Sequel Packets. The Directed Packet carries the Message-describing
 * information and the first chunk of Message data, and the Sequel Packets
 * carry any additional chunks of Message data that did not fit into the
 * Directed Packet.
 * 
 * A recipient of "point" Message Packets is responsible for acknowledging the
 * receipt of those Packets. The Ack Packet is sent back to the sender to
 * acknowledge one or more "point" Message Packets.
 * 
 * If a recipient determines that it missed a "point" Message Packet, it can
 * send a Request Packet to tell the sender of the "point" Message Packet that
 * the "point" Message Packet was never received and is being waited upon by
 * the recipient.
 * 
 * The Ack and Request Packets are referred to as Notify Packets because they
 * are used by one Member to Notify another Member of Packet communication
 * success and failure.
