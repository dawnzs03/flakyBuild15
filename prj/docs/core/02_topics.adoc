== Topics Management

This version of Coherence introduces additional features and functionality to help you manage and monitor
topics within a Coherence cluster.  New Topics MBeans are at the core with three new
reports allowing for analysis of these MBeans overtime as well as additional Management over REST endpoints to interact with the MBeans.

The Coherence CLI and VisualVM plugin now support viewing and managing Topics and new Grafana Dashboards are available to view
Topics metrics over time.

=== Topics MBeans

Three new Topics MBeans are now available, `PagedTopic`, `PagedTopicSubscriber` and `PagedTopicSubscriberGroup` MBean.
These are described in more detail below:

==== PagedTopic MBean

The `PagedTopic` MBean provides statistics for Topic services running in a cluster. A cluster contains zero or more instances of this MBean,
each instance representing an instance of a Topic on a member.

The object name of the MBean is:

   type=PagedTopic,service=ServiceName,name=TopicName,nodeId=node

[#rest]
=== Management over REST

You are now able to view and manage Topics, Subscribers and Subscriber Groups using Management over REST API.

For example, to retrieve the topics for a service you can use the following `curl` command replacing `serviceName` with your Topics service name.

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
curl http://host:port/management/coherence/cluster/services/serviceName/topics
----

See {commercial-docs-base-url}/rest-reference/index.html[REST API for Managing Oracle Coherence] for full details of the available REST end points.

[#mgmt]
=== Topics Management via CLI and VisualVM

The Coherence VisualVM Plugin and Coherence CLI have been updated to provide management and monitoring of Topics within a Coherence cluster.
See the following links for more information on each of the tools.

* Coherence CLI - See https://github.com/oracle/coherence-cli[Coherence CLI] on GitHub and https://oracle.github.io/coherence-cli/docs/latest/#/docs/reference/01_overview[CLI Command Reference].

* Coherence VisualVM Plugin - See https://github.com/oracle/coherence-visualvm[Coherence VisualVM] on GitHub

[#grafana]
=== Topics Grafana Dashboards

There are four new Grafana Dashboards available to show Topics related information:

* Topics Summary
* Topic Details
* Topic Subscriber Details
* Topic Subscriber Group Details

The above dashboards are available from the https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator/tree/main/dashboards/grafana[Coherence Operator] GitHub repository.

See the Oracle {commercial-docs-base-url}/manage/using-coherence-metrics.html[Metrics Documentation] for more information on configuring metrics.
