Currently, only a tiny percentage of mountain passes have a direction key set. It would be desirable to add this key to all mountain passes worldwide.","deleted":false,"infoLink":"","owner":2154858,"parent":40318,"featured":false,"requiresLocal":false,"blurb":"Add direction tag to mountain passes","enabled":true,"difficulty":1,"changesetUrl":false,"cooperativeType":0,"instruction":"Add the direction tag (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:direction) as a value in degrees (0-359) according to the Wiki direction tag page to each mountain pass node. You can, or should, use both aerial imagery and take into account the direction of existing paths going through the mountain pass. Most useful though is to use OpenTopoMap as background, as it has both hillshading and contours that clearly depict the topography of the mountain pass.","popularity":1654006858,"checkinComment":"Added direction tag to mountain pass #maproulette","checkinSource":"","virtualParents":[],"remoteGeoJson":"","overpassQL":"node[\"mountain_pass\"=\"yes\"][\"direction\"!~\".*\"];out meta;","lowPriorityRule":{},"defaultPriority":0,"highPriorityRule":{},"mediumPriorityRule":{},"preferredTags":"mountain,mountain pass,direction","defaultZoom":16,"maxZoom":19,"isArchived":false,"defaultBasemapId":"MAPNIK","minZoom":3,"osmIdProperty":"","updateTasks":false,"customBasemap":"","defaultBasemap":4,"limitTags":false,"limitReviewTags":false,"exportableProperties":"","presets":[],"taskStyles":[],"status":3,"statusMessage":"","lastTaskRefresh":"2020-04-27T14:11:09.301Z","dataOriginDate":"2020-04-27T14:11:09.301Z","location":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.3576675976218,40.7225165949249]},"bounding":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-162.722976266306,-79.6634195243996],[-162.722976266306,70.4507805163598],[177.351640766306,70.4507805163598],[177.351640766306,-79.6634195243996],[-162.722976266306,-79.6634195243996]]]},"completionPercentage":0,"tasksRemaining":27363,"tags":["mountain","direction","mountain pass"]}
