JMeterDSL is really easy to pick up for a team with some familiar with Java and JMeter.  My team was able to learn and start using it within a day! We love it that we can create reusable and extensible "script" components to assemble our performance tests with great ease. The ability to branch and merge (no more XML!) is a breath of fresh air. The ability to run the tests locally or remotely (Azure, in our case) is exactly what we are looking for! Thank you for creating this!

java-jmeter-dsl is a real breath of fresh air for us.  This tool gave us a new vision of how tests can be built, how to integrate them into processes and how to automate them.  And we can do all this on the basis of the well-known popular and proven Apache JMeter engine. java-jmeter-dsl gives your JMeter-based tests maintainability and reusability at the level of any code solution, which is actually a must for large teams or teams with a large number of tests

As more of a java developer and less of a jmeter engineer, I have always wished this

I am an early bird user, it is so elegant, extendable, and flexible even from the first commits, thank you so much, Roger and Team. Java DSL is one love for sure! Inspired me to new ideas, and allowed me to verify the correctness of my theories - Java DSL rock this Jmeter party!!!

JMeter DSL brings JMeter to the frontline of technological ingenuity.
It solves most of the problems traditionally associated with JMeter such as lack of dependency management, difficulties with source control integration and difficulties to extend.

That, with addition to the highly engaging attitude of Abstracta, has inspired me into extending the project further by introducing [PYmeter](https://pymeter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a python DSL package for JMeter based on jmeter-java-dsl.

java-jmeter-dsl is a great tool because it can help you reuse your REST-assured tests in order to create some performance test cases. It's very useful because you can generate JTL files to create JMeter reports and even use InfluxDB and Grafana to generate very nice graphics.

I tried using JMeter-Java-DSL. It's awesome, I can combine Selenium & JMeter library code in single script from comfort of my IDE.

JMeter Java DSL is a really useful avatar of the load testing tool. This is specially good for CI/CD projects where developers should be using some form of performance evaluation to validate a good build.

I was looking for simplicity of test plan implementation, reusability of components, assertion on metrics, html report per test, ease of debugging and maintenance, great support and documentation with tons of examples - and I found them here. JMeter DSL covers JMeter's missing functionality and does it great.

I always wished to have easy DSL for jmeter when other tools were supporting such as gatling. I was delighted when jmeter dsl was introduced and tried in my work project. It works so good in simple projects. Establishing CI pipeline is also smooth and easy now in organisation. Thank you for your valuable effort.
