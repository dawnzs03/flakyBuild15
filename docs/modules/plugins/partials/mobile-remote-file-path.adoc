.2+.^| `$filePath`
|iOS
|The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be downloaded/deleted from
the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use
`@<app_bundle_id>:<optional_container_type>/<path_to_the_file_or_folder_inside_containe>` format to download/delete a file from an application
container of the given type. The only supported container type for real devices is `documents`. Containers available for Simulators: `app`, `data`,
`groups`, `<A specific App Group container>`. If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container
is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If `@com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png` is provided, `On My iPhone/<app name>` in Files app
will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/<app name>.
|`/DCIM/100APPLE/image.png` or `@com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt`

|Android
|The full path to the remote file or a specially formatted path, which points to an item inside an app bundle, for example `@my.app.id/my/path`.
It is mandatory for the app bundle to have debugging enabled in order to use the latter remotePath format.
|`/sdcard/myfile.txt` or `@my.app.id/path/in/bundle`
