# Adding way nodes

This mode can be entered via the simple mode __Add way__ action, via a long click otherwise, and via the __Append__ action in way and node selection modes. 

You can then do one of three things

* **touch in the same place again** - this will finish adding nodes to the way and start the property editor. If the location is within the tolerance zone of a way it will be added as a new node to that way.
* **touch some other place on the screen** - this will create a way segment from the previous location to the current location, the way can be extended by adding further nodes. Touching the last location completes the way and starts the tag editor. If the initial location was near a node that will be used as the first node, and if it was on a way, a new node will be inserted in to that way.
* **select a menu item** see below

The complete way can be moved without leaving this mode.
