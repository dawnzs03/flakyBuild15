# Preset filter

Vespucci provides a simple mechanism to filter displayed and editable objects based on which preset that they match to. Elements that are not selectable and visible will be drawn with light grey lines.

The preset filter is enabled by selecting the corresponding menu entry in the menu on the main map display.

If the filter is only using one preset item (not a group) then that preset will automatically be applied when a new object is created.

## Actions  

### Selecting a preset

The preset screen can be navigated similar to the other preset selection menus:

* clicking a group (light grey background) will enter and display the group
* clicking a preset (dark grey background) will select that preset for use in the filter
* long clicking a group will select the whole group
