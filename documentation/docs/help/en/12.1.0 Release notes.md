# Vespucci 12.1 Highlights

2019-01-20

This is a minor release with little new functionality, however as the preset support changes are not backwards compatible it was not suitable for a patch release.

## Miscellaneous

* ~~Use most recently used tags when applying preset~~ (Reverted in 12.1.2)
* Support "wiki" attribute in presets
* Support splitting via ways in turn-restrictions
* Add marker to share on OpenStreetMap URL
* multiple small behaviour improvements

# Upgrading from previous versions

# Known problems
