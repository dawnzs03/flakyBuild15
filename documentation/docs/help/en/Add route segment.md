# Add route segment

In this mode you can add segments to an existing or new route relation. Ways will automatically split if necessary and only ways that are connected to the route will be selectable.

To finish adding segments click the the check button, selecting the back button will abort the mode not adding any of the segements.

Note: aborting does not undo any way splits that were necessary.
